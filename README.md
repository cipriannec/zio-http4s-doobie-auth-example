# zio-http4s-doobie-auth-example

Welcome to my ZIO playground. Of course, I wanted to add all my favourite frameworks, which includes:

- http4s
- circe
- doobie
- postgres
- pureconfig

## What it does?

It's a really simple app and just has to access point:

1. Show alle existing users in a database via the [/](http://127.0.0.1:8080) route
2. Allow existing users too authenticate via the [/secure](http://127.0.0.1:8080/secure) route

## How to run it?

As always, check out the git repo:

``````
